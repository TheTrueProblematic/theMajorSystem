        <h2>The Major System</h2>
        <p>
            The Major System is a mnemonic technique that converts numbers into memorable words or phrases by assigning specific consonant sounds to each digit from 0 to 9.<br/>
            Each number is linked to one or more consonant sounds, for example, 1 is often associated with T or D, 2 with N, 3 with M, and so on, allowing you to transform numerical sequences into a phonetic code.<br/>
            By inserting vowels (which are not assigned any digit) between the consonants, you can form words that are much easier to remember than raw numbers.<br/>
            This system is particularly effective for memorizing telephone numbers, dates, or long strings of random digits, as it turns abstract numbers into concrete, vivid images or stories.<br/>
            <br/>
