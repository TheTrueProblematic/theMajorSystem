# Major System Test

Practice the Major System with this interactive web application.

## Description

This web application allows you to practice the Major Systemâ€”a mnemonic technique for converting numbers into words. The app displays a random number, and your task is to enter a word that corresponds to that number based on the Major System rules.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: Generates a random number with a user-selected number of digits (1-10).
- **User Input Validation**: Checks if the entered word correctly represents the displayed number.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes using the icon in the top-right corner.
- **Adjustable Difficulty**: Use the slider at the bottom to select the number of digits.

## How to Use

1. **Adjust the Number of Digits**:
    - Use the slider at the bottom of the page to select a number between 1 and 10. This determines the length of the random number.
2. **View the Random Number**:
    - A random number with the selected number of digits will appear in the center of the page.
3. **Enter a Word**:
    - Type a word into the input box that corresponds to the displayed number using the Major System rules.
4. **Submit Your Answer**:
    - Press the **Enter** key to submit your word.
5. **Receive Feedback**:
    - If your word is correct, a "Correct!" message will appear, and a new number will be displayed.
    - If incorrect, an "Incorrect!" message will appear, and you can try again with the same number.
6. **Toggle Dark Mode**:
    - Click the icon in the top-right corner to switch between light and dark modes.

## Major System Overview

The Major System is a mnemonic technique that helps you remember numbers by converting them into words through a set of consonant sounds.

### Letter-to-Digit Mapping

| Digit | Letters                          |
|-------|----------------------------------|

| 1     | t, d, th                         |
| 2     | n                                |
| 3     | m                                |
